# stand_alone_oomph-lib_user_code

Repository with basic code to illustrates how to link users' code against oomph-lib.

The driver code one_d_poisson.cc is basically a copy of that in the

      demo_drivers/poisson/one_d_poisson

directory in the oomph-lib repository. The CMakeLists.txt explains how to
link this against an existing installation of oomph-lib.

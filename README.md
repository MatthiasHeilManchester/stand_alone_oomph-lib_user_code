# stand_alone_oomph-lib_user_code

Repository with basic code to illustrate how to link users' driver code against an existing installation of `oomph-lib`.

The driver code `one_d_poisson.cc` is basically a copy of that in the
```
      demo_drivers/poisson/one_d_poisson
```
directory in the [oomph-lib](https://oomph-lib.github.io/oomph-lib/doc/html/)
repository. The `CMakeLists.txt` file explains how to link this against an existing installation of `oomph-lib`.
